# My first project for a hackathon - Explore a new programming language

Original description of the challenge: "Pick up a new programming language to try. You can translate one of your existing projects into it, or even just learn how to say hello, world! Submit your code on our Devpost."


## Trying out JavaScript

The challange was to try out a (for us) new programming language. I have never used JavaScript before. But I always wanted to try it out. So I decided to build this project with JavaScript. I have already built a few projects with HTML5 and CSS3, but all of my projects are written in German. That's why I decided to build a new project from scratch.

### The project
+ has two parts
+ was built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
+ is very small and you can find everything in the html file
+ works :)

### First part
+ at first you will be asked to give your age - **question**
+ has three possibilities
    + Under 7 years: You are not allowed to visit the website and to play the game (part 2)
    + Under 75 years: You are allowed to visit the website and to play the game
    + Above 75 years: Definitely give it a try. It is funny.
 + I have originally planned to build it.

### Second part
- is a **High-Low Guessing Game**
- is a game that I didn't even know existed until two days ago
- was really difficult for me, because
    + I created an infinite loop...
    + without to know the basics of a programming language is difficult to search for a bug, or in this case for the bugs...
- I spent five hours to fix the problems and/or to create a better game. But at the end I searched for an other solution and I tried to improve my code with that. But my best solution worked only 66,6%. Finally, when I almost gave up the idea of the game, I found a solution which **_works_**.
- wasn't part of my original plan. But I am glad to have built it and I am planning to improve it in the future.

### Conclusion
It was a really useful project. Now I know exactly every part of the code. However I am still searching for my original bugs... Besides I even learned how to comment and make a line break in JavaScript. Furthermore, this is my first README file and my first project in GitHub. In the future I am going to improve this code (after or during learning of the basics of JavaScript). I am looking forward to participate in the next Global Hack Week :)
